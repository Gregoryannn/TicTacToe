# TicTacToe
Tic Tac Toe is a two players game. There will be a board of three by three table cell and two symbols in this game, one for each player. Both players can choose the symbol of their choice. Then they will mark the sign inside of a box of the board. One who got their symbol marked in a sequence of three may be vertical, horizontal, or diagonal.

That player will have won the match, and the player will lose the game who does not get his symbol in a sequence of three. If both of the players do not get their symbols in a line of three, the match will be tie or draw.  This is the Tic Tac Toe game logic.
